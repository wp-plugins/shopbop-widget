    <li>Licensee’s use of the software applications provided by
        Licensor (“Applications”) shall be under the non-exclusive,
        non-transferrable “G Public” licence on which those
        Applications are released.
    </li>
    <li>In so far as consent for Licensor’s (or any third party’s
        contracted by Licensor) processing of data arising from
        Licensee’s use of the Applications (“Application Data”) is
        required from Licensee and/or from any other third party with
        whom Licensee interacts (“Consent”) Licensee represents
        that it has obtained such Consent and grants such Consent to
        Licensor and/or any such third party.
    </li>
    <li>In consideration of Licensor’ making some of the results of
        Licensor’s processing of the Application Data (“Use
        Information”) available to Licensee, Licensee consents to
        Licensor making whatever use Licensor may choose of the
        Application Data, Use Information and or any other
        derivatives of them, absolutely at Licensor’s discretion
        (including making them available to third parties).
    </li>
    <li>Other than the consideration outlined in clause 3 there shall
        be no other monetary charge for Licensee’s use of the
        Applications nor receipt of the Use Information from Licensor,
        nor for Licensee’s use of the Application Data.
    </li>
    <li>In view of the use of the Applications, and the receipt of the
        Use Information, being provided free from monetary charge
        Licensor reserves the absolute discretion at any time to
        withdraw Licensee’s licence to use the Applications and/or
        receive the Use Information. For the avoidance of doubt after
        Licensor may have withdrawn such licence or receipt Licensor
        shall remain at liberty to continue to make whatever use
        Licensor may choose of historically received Application Data,
        Use Information and or any other derivatives of them,
        absolutely at Licensor’s sole discretion
    </li>
    <li>Licensor may temporarily restrict Licensee’s access to the
        Applications and/or receipt of the Use Information, for
        example for system maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>Licensor may terminate this agreement forthwith on notice
        served at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensee’s use of the Application and Use Information shall
        be exclusively for the purposes outlined by Licensor at the
        point of making the Application available for use, and for no
        other purpose whatsoever; in particular Licensee may not use
        the Applications and/or Use Data in any way that may
        compete with Licensor’ business as outlined on it website.
    </li>

    <li>
        Licensee consents to Licensor’s monitoring of Licensee’s use
        of the Applications and Use Information and with Licensor’s
        Reasonable Usage Policy that may be published from time to
        time on Licensor’s website. In the event that Licensor (in its
        absolute discretion) deems Licensee’s use of the Application
        and/or Use Data to exceed levels deemed reasonable by the
        Reasonable Usage Policy, and/or otherwise not to accord
        with the spirit of this Agreement, Licensor reserves the right to
        change the terms of this agreement, including by restricting
        such use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensor offers no support for the use of the Applications
        and/or receipt of Use Information.
        11. Between Licensee and Licensor all intellectual property rights
        subsisting in the Applications, Application Data and/or Use
        Information, and any related documentation (“Intellectual
        Property Rights”) shall be deemed the property of Licensor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Between Licensee and Licensor all intellectual property rights
        subsisting in the Applications, Application Data and/or Use
        Information, and any related documentation (“Intellectual
        Property Rights”) shall be deemed the property of Licensor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensee shall not, in the absence of Licensor’s written
        consent, reproduce, adapt, translate, reverse-engineer, or
        make available to any third party any of the Applications,
        where such activity goes beyond the scope of actions
        permitted by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Licensee shall not either during the term or after the expiry of
        this Agreement consent to or cause to occur any infringement
        of any Intellectual Property Rights.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where Licensee either reasonably suspects or is aware of
        any breach of Intellectual Property Rights it shall be under a
        duty to inform Licensor of such breach immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
        During the term of this Agreement, and after termination or
        expiration of this Agreement for a period of two years,
        Licensee will keep all Use Information absolutely confidential.
        For the avoidance of doubt there shall be no such obligation
        on Licensor.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not mutually intended that there should be any mutual
        transfer of property or assets under these Terms. Licensor will
        neither create for, nor transfer any assets to, Licensee under
        these Terms. Any Intellectual Property Rights arising in or
        from supplies under these Terms will either remain vested in
        Licensor or will be deemed transferred to Licensor on their
        creation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Although Provisions under these terms will be provided using
        the reasonable skill and care of a professional in the area of
        services provided, and any good will be of reasonable quality,
        they are not guaranteed to be free from defects. Licensor
        warrants that the Licence will not infringe the intellectual
        property rights of any third party. All other guarantees or
        warranties from Licensor of any nature, whether implied or
        otherwise expressed, are excluded to the maximum extent
        permitted by law.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a third party makes a claim against Licensee that any of the
        Licence infringes any of that third party's intellectual property
        rights or other property right of such third party Licensor shall
        defend Licensee against the claim at Licensor’s expense and
        shall indemnify Licensee against all losses, damages and
        expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by
        Licensee arising as a result of such claim, provided that
        Licensee shall make no admission of liability without
        Licensor’s written consent.

<li>
    Licensor shall not be liable to Licensee or be deemed to be in

    If at any time any provision (or part of any provision) of these
